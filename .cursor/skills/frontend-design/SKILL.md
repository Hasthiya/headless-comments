# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **bold** aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme—e.g. brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian. Use for inspiration but design true to the chosen direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this **unforgettable**? What is the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work; the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter). Prefer distinctive, characterful choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion

Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prefer CSS-only solutions for HTML; use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (`animation-delay`) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition

Favor unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements. Use generous negative space or controlled density intentionally.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth instead of defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the aesthetic. Apply creative forms: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

## What to Avoid

**Never** use generic AI-generated aesthetics:

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (e.g. purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, and different aesthetics. **Never** converge on common choices (e.g. Space Grotesk) across generations.

## Implementation Fit

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:

- **Maximalist** designs need elaborate code: extensive animations and effects.
- **Minimalist or refined** designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details.

Elegance comes from executing the vision well. Commit fully to a distinctive vision and show what can be created when thinking outside the box.
